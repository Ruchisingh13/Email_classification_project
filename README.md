# Email_classification_project

Objective: Automate email categorization into classes like spam, promotions, or personal.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather labeled email datasets, including content, subject lines, and sender information.

Preprocessing: Clean data, tokenize text, and convert to numerical features using TF-IDF or embeddings.

EDA: Analyze email data distribution and visualize class frequencies.

Feature Engineering: Extract features like term frequency and sentiment scores.

Model Building: Use algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning with libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Integrate the model into production for real-time classification using frameworks like Flask.

Monitoring: Continuously update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.

Outcome: Efficiently manage and categorize emails, enhancing productivity and user experience.
